####Week 2
#####OPTIONAL PROJECTS (video/audio/track tags)

**Project 3 (with JavaScript knowledge):** try to play a video file or an audio file with an external synchronization. Use the progress event and the currentTime property from the audio and video objects you can manipulate with the JavaScript API described in the course. For example, please display some text aside the video, and/or display a wikipedia page in an iframe, and/or display a google map if you know how to do it.

####Week3 (canvas)

#####OPTIONAL PROJECTS (3.2 Basics of HTML5 canvas)

Here are a few project ideas. Your classmates and the team who prepared the course will all be glad to try them and give some feedback. Please post URLs in this discussion forum. These projects are optional, meaning that they won't be graded.


**Project 1 (easy):** Make a small drawing by just using rectangles and text  (a car, a monster, a head, or whatever you like).
* **status:** incomplete
* **link:** none


**Project 2:** Make an histogram (bar charts made of filled rectangles) as an array of integer values such as: var data = {1, 12, 20, 14, 13, 9, 5}, for example.
* **status:** incomplete
* **link:** none


**Project 3 (harder, for those who know JavaScript and a little bit of math):** Try to draw a human shaped robot using different 2D transforms (translate, rotate). Build a hierarchic skeleton (if we rotate the arm, the forearm and the hand should follow). This can be done by having the function that draws an arm save the context, move the coordinate system, call another function that draws the forearm, that saves the context, move the coordinate system to the end of the arm, call the function that draws the hand, etc. By consecutively calling functions from one another, with each function that saves the context -- moves the coordinate system -- calls another function -- restores the context, we can build a hierarchy of coordinate systems.

#####OPTIONAL PROJECTS (3.3 Immediate drawing mode: rectangles, text and images)

Here are a few project ideas. Your classmates and the team who prepared the course will all be glad to try them and give some feedback. Please post URLs in this discussion forum. These projects are optional, meaning that they won't be graded.


**Project 1 (easy):** Make a funny application by mixing all the things seen so far: images, colors, texts, video...
* **status:** incomplete
* **link:** none


**Project 2:** Write a small application triggering a screenshot from the Webcam.
* **status:** incomplete
* **link:** none


**Project 3 (a bit harder, need to know how to use CSS positioning and the CSS z-index property):** Try to position a canvas on top of a video element and draw shapes on top of the video.
* **status:** incomplete
* **link:** none


**Project 4 (follow-up of project 3):** Play two videos in loop mode at the same time, and draw the current image of the video 2 in the canvas on top of video 1, in a smaller size.
* **status:** incomplete
* **link:** none

#####OPTIONAL PROJECTS (3.4 Path drawing mode: lines, circles, arcs, curves and other path drawing methods)

Here are a few project ideas. Your classmates and the team who prepared the course will all be glad to try them and give some feedback. Please post URLs in this discussion forum. These projects are optional, meaning that they won't be graded.


**Project 1 (easy):** Create a small monster using rectangles, arcs, lines, etc. Just drawing a monster head will do the work. Start with something simple: a circle for the head, two squares for the eyes, a line for the mouth, etc., then set some colors and line widths.
* **status:** incomplete

**Project 2:** Same as above but make use of patterns.
* **status:** incomplete
* **link:** none


**Project 3 (harder):** Try to draw the current image of a video played in background, hidden using CSS, as the animated background of the canvas.
* **status:** incomplete
* **link:** none


**Project 4 (follow-up of project 3):** You can also use the trick with the video to create animated textures for the eyes, skin, etc.
